\begin{abstract}
While robots have the potential for increasing dexterity for completing manufacturing tasks, the lack of naturalistic robot manipulation make it difficult for non-experts to control the robot for a desired task. We explore the question of naturalistic control of a robot arm for tasks that have one-to-one mapping to natural human movement, and those that do not against typical joystick control. Through our exploration, we have developed a system that uses computer vision and a data glove to determine an individual's hand position and orientation in three-dimensional space. We map this position and orientation input to the robot's end effector. We show that using a combination of kinesiological control plus specialty functions can achieve similar performance and user perceptions to a joystick. Additionally, kinesiological control without direct mapping to the full range of the robot's actuated motion impairs performance for tasks that could benefit from it. Interestingly, task type had a strong effect on user perception of the control method. We note that further research in this area is needed to fully explore the potential of kinesiological control of co-working robots.

\section{Introduction}

Manipulation of external robot interfaces can be a challenging tasks, and moreso to enable novice controllers to control actuated motion with dexterity.  The multitude of methods and techniques for manipulating many robot actuators to accomplish seemingly simple tasks generally require extensive training and practice.  Many typical control methods for actuated robots require the operator to make a cognitive map from control space to the three-dimensional space in which the robot operates.  In our work, we explore kinesological control of a robot arm for novice users, looking at precision tasks that have a one-to-one mapping with human motion and those that do not.  We constract this kinesological control with conventional joystick manipulation, which provides more direct input to the robot.  

In the implementation of our work, we have developed a system that uses computer vision to track an individual's arm in three-dimensional space and map that input to the end effector of a Kinova Mico robot arm.  Our kinesological implementation allows for real-time manipulation and control of the robot arm in real-time, and in conjunction with gyroscope readings from a smart glove worn by the individual, allows a user to move, rotate, and actuate fingers of the hand without direct manipulation of a joystick. In our experimentation, we also allow users to use the Kinova-included joystick to accomplish similar tasks. Through our study, we show how tasks that do not map one-to-one with natural movement can have limitations that need non-kinesological (e.g. direct) control to overcome.  However, we also show that depending on the task type, the control type had a strong effect on user perception.

\section{Background}

Advances in the areas of computer vision and robot control have enabled us to able to rapidly prototype and se these techniques to allow for novice control of a robot arm.  In particular, we utilized the Kinect for Windows SDK~\cite{Kinect} to quickly capture an individuals arm with a Microsoft Kinect.  By piping hand locations over the network to a machine running the ROS (Robot Operating System) system~\cite{ROS} interfaced to the Kinova robot arm, we are able to directly control the robot using kinesological control.

Several prior studies have looked at how remote control of robots can assist in manufacturing and human-robot collaboration tasks. Our work context follows a long line of research in bilateral teleoperation (see Hokayem and Spong for a wide-spanning survey~\cite{hokayem2006bilateral}), which concerns issues of stability and telepresence.  Critically, the two-way feedback mechanisms between the human operator and the robotic analog needs to be such to minimize perceptible latency in the connection, and also provide enough feedback to judge and adapt input.  Park \emph{et al.} represents some early work in teleoperation to help smooth error in input to the output trajectory in the robot.  The authors use differing stiffnesses of objects that the robot interacts with to vary how the robot communicates with the controller, and represents an advancement in bilateral teleoperation.

In more recent work, research has started to generalize insights from individual application of telepresence applications.  In particular, Dragan \emph{et al.}~\cite{dragan2013teleoperation} explore teleoperation with customizable interfaces.  Importantly, they identify that both the task context and assistive scaffolding (e.g. input goal estimation) are necessary to support teleoperation and manipulations of complex systems. Specific to the goals of our project, Gi-Hun \emph{et al.}'s work on online retargeting for teleoperation~\cite{yang2013online} shows the utility of using the Kinect to collect natural movement of an operator and mapping input to the end-effector of a robot, while Labonte \emph{et al.}~\cite{labonte2010comparative} identify potential scaffolds to assist novice users using different viewpoints in a telehomecare applications.  While this work sets the context for our work, no work to date has looked at supporting and empirically evaluating different kinesthetic methods for novice control of an actuated robot.

In constructing our qualitative scales for post-hoc questionnaires, we used two seminal studies to report user preferences.  Davis~\cite{Davis1989} presents a methodological approach to measuring participants' perceived usefulness, ease-of-use, and acceptance of information interfaces. Although we adapt this to robot-human interaction, this adaptation of this scale to other interfaces has some precedence---Lin \emph{et al.}~\cite{Lin2008} uses such an adaptation to measure interaction and perception of experience on the Internet.  We use the scale to measure user perceived usefulness, ease-of-use, and acceptance of the control method with regard to each task performed.

\section{Experimental Study}

Our study involved different control methods of a Kinova Mico arm, while looking at differnet types of tasks that either easily or did not easily map to natural human movement.  In order to enable capture of participants arm motion to manipulate the robot arm, we use the Kinect to capture the position of the participants right hand in three-dimensional space, as well as a VML data glove, providing clearer hand orientation.  The participant has the ability to use their off-hand to change the gripper state on the robot arm---a closed fist and an open palm close and open the gripper, respectively.  Input was captured on a machine, and hand position, orientation, and gripper state are passed via UDP packets at 4Hz to a receiving machine running the ROS application that can direct the Mico robot arm. Figure~\ref{fig:demo} shows an example setup of an experimental trial. 

Our research question concerns the effect of kinesiological robot arm control on novice user task performance and perception for tasks that do and do not have kinesiological mappings to human motion.  Based on our two tasks, we derived three input modalities, two of which are based on our kinesiological capture system.  One modality captures the hand position and orientation, while the other augments this with direct control of non-natural robot actuation (e.g. rotating the robot wrist more than a full rotation).  We call this second modality ``kines+'' in our work. The third input control is the packaged joystick with the Mico robot.  The joystick has several modes---the primary moves the end effector in three-dimensional space through a bidirectional pad and adds the third dimension via twists of the control knob.  The other modes modify elbow orientation or wrist orientation and hand gripping.  

We hypothesize that kinesiological control of the robot arm for natural mappings of tasks will perform better than the two other modes of control, and likewise hypothesize that direct control of the robot with the joystick will help users accomplish tasks that do not have direct mappings. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the combined control method (kines+) will perform as well or better than kinesiological control for tasks with natural mappings, and better than joystick control for tasks without natural mappings.

The experimental design is a $3\times2$ factorial design with the three input modalities: joystick, kinesiological control, and kinesiological augmented with direct input (kines+); and two task types: direct mapping to natural movement, and robot-augmented movement.  We implemented our study as a mixed-methods design to minimize learning effects of manipulating the robot. Control modality was beteween-participants and task type was within-participants. Each participant was randomly assigned a control modality and asked to complete two tasks (in counterbalanced order).  We collected participants ($n=12$) from within a university setting between the ages of 19--40 ($\mu = 27.1, \rho = 5.5$; 2 females, 10 males).

\subsection{Procedure}

Participants were randomly assigned their input modality randomly.  Each participant was given an instruction sheet with how to manipulate the robot and given an unbounded amount of time to manipulate and practice with the assigned input method.  Once a confirmation was given by the participant to proceed, they were given an instruction sheet for the task.  After reading and confirming that no clarification questions were needed, a timer was started and stopped when the desired action was completed, with an upper-bound of five minutes.  The one-to-one mapping task requested the participant to move a cup from one location on a table to another location (we call this the ``movement'' task), while the non one-to-one mapping required a 360 rotation of the cup in-place (requiring lifting of the cup; ``rotation'' task).  Upon completion, the remaining task type was administered in the same fashion.  After the completion of the two tasks, demographic and robot familiarity information was collected.

To assess the performance and perception of these different control types, we use task completion time as an analog for task completion performance.  To measure perception of different control types for each task type, we administered a questionnaire along the dimensions of Davis~\cite{Davis1989} after each unique combinations of factors, measuring participant perception of the manipulation method with the task type along dimensions of usefulness, ease-of-use, and acceptance.  Each participant completed each task for their randomly assigned input modality once.
